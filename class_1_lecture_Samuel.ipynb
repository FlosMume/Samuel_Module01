Experts argue that addressing authorized fraud requires collaboration among banks, telecoms, and customers.

Quast received refunds but feels her publishing experience is marred by the scam.\n"

    "Should banks have to cover scam losses?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi. My name is Alexandra Posadzki, and I write about financial crime and cybercrime.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Crystal Quast, a corporate communications professional from Waterloo, Ont., contacted me several months ago to share her story about a publishing scam, I was intrigued.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having published a book myself fairly recently, I’ve received countless e-mails promising to help me sell more copies; my publicist had warned me that they are scams.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was never entirely clear to me how such a scam worked or why scammers would be targeting authors, so when Quast offered to walk me through the self-publishing scam that had ensnared her, I eagerly agreed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quast had written a mystery novel and gone online looking for Amazon’s self-publishing arm. But the link that she clicked – one of the sponsored links at the top of Google’s search results – took her to an imposter company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quast caught on to the fact that she wasn’t really dealing with Amazon when she got back the first batch of edits on her manuscript – the company was charging $2,500 for a package that was supposed to include editing – and spotted glaring typos that had been overlooked. A friend who worked at Amazon subsequently confirmed her suspicions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that I find most fascinating about the world of financial crime is the spot where its Venn diagram circle overlaps with that of the legitimate business world. As Quast’s experience illustrates, the impact of scams on the business ecosystem is broad, touching everything from companies like Amazon, whose brands are being abused, to the search engines helping scammers recruit victims, to the banks facilitating the fraudulent payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud victims reported a total of $647-million in losses to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre last year. Meanwhile, the centre estimates that just 5 per cent to 10 per cent of frauds are reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "And with so many players involved, the question of liability becomes complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "I spoke with Geoff Morton, senior director of fraud strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, about the shift from unauthorized to authorized fraud and the challenge it poses for banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Morton, the burden shouldn’t fall solely on the banks. Tackling authorized fraud requires collaboration between numerous parties, including telecom companies, social-media platforms, search engines and, importantly, customers, he told me: “We really need to bring everybody to the table.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Some countries have taken novel approaches to tackling the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Britain, financial liability for authorized push payment scams, which occur when a customer is tricked into sending money to someone posing as a genuine payee, is split equally between the bank that sent the money and the one that received it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Singapore has adopted what’s known as a waterfall model to determining who should bear the cost when a customer falls prey to a phishing attack. The financial institution is on the hook unless it can prove that it met all of its legal obligations to prevent the attack. The responsibility shifts next to the telecom, and finally to the victim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Canada’s regulations are a patchwork, according to Sara Eve Levac, a lawyer and analyst at Montreal-based consumer advocacy Option consommateurs. For instance, the Bank Act limits the consumer’s liability for unauthorized credit-card transactions to $50. But for other modes of payment, such as a debit transaction, there’s no legal protection. Option consommateurs has been advocating for changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quast, meanwhile, has received refunds on both of the credit cards she used to pay the Amazon publishing impersonators. But the experience of publishing her first novel, Dinked: Serenity Acres: Where Secrets Barely Stay Hidden, which should have been a joyous one, is now tainted with the shame of having been suckered into a scam.\n",

      "Once upon a time, in the misty mountains of Eldoria, there lived a dragon named Zephyr. Unlike the other dragons who reveled in hoarding gold and terrorizing villages, Zephyr had a curious mind and a heart full of dreams. He often gazed down at the bustling towns below, fascinated by the humans and their strange, glowing devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, while soaring through the clouds, Zephyr spotted a group of children gathered around a flickering screen in a small village. They were laughing and pointing as colorful characters danced across the display. Intrigued, Zephyr swooped down, careful to remain hidden behind a cluster of trees. He watched as the children clicked and typed, their faces alight with joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are they doing?” he wondered, his golden eyes sparkling with curiosity. \n",
      "\n",
      "As the sun dipped below the horizon, Zephyr decided he had to find out. He flew to the village under the cover of night, landing softly in a secluded glade. There, he found an old, dusty book left behind by a traveler. The title read, “Introduction to Coding: A Beginner’s Guide.” \n",
      "\n",
      "With a flick of his claw, he opened the book and began to read. The words danced before his eyes, and though they were strange, he felt a spark of understanding. “If I can learn this,” he thought, “I could create something magical!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Days turned into weeks as Zephyr immersed himself in the world of coding. He practiced in secret, using his massive claws to tap out lines of code on a makeshift keyboard he fashioned from fallen branches and stones. He learned about loops, functions, and variables, his mind racing with possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, he decided to create a game—a simple adventure where players could explore a dragon’s lair, solve puzzles, and collect treasures. He poured his heart into it, crafting each line of code with care. As he worked, he imagined the joy it would bring to the children he had watched from afar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, after countless nights of coding, Zephyr completed his game. He was nervous but excited. With a deep breath, he summoned the courage to reveal himself to the village. Under the cover of night, he flew to the town square, where a large screen had been set up for a festival.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a mighty roar, he landed, startling the villagers. But instead of fleeing, they stood in awe of the magnificent creature before them. Zephyr took a step forward, his heart pounding. “Fear not!” he bellowed, his voice echoing through the square. “I come not to harm, but to share a gift!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He unfurled his wings, revealing a shimmering tablet that displayed his game. The villagers gasped, and the children’s eyes widened with excitement. “I have learned to code,” Zephyr continued, “and I wish to share my creation with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a flick of his claw, he activated the game. The screen lit up, and the villagers watched in amazement as the adventure unfolded. Laughter erupted as the children took turns playing, their joy infectious. Zephyr felt a warmth in his heart, a feeling he had never known before.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day on, Zephyr became a beloved figure in the village. He taught the children how to code, sharing his knowledge and igniting their imaginations. The once-feared dragon became a mentor, a friend, and a symbol of creativity and collaboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the years passed, Zephyr’s legend grew. He was no longer just a dragon of the mountains; he was a bridge between two worlds, proving that even the fiercest of creatures could learn, grow, and inspire. And in the heart of Eldoria, the bond between dragons and humans flourished, all thanks to a dragon who dared to dream beyond the clouds.\n"

      "Making a perfect omelette is a skill that can elevate your breakfast game and impress your guests. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you achieve that fluffy, flavorful result:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2-3 large eggs (preferably fresh)\n",
      "- Salt (to taste)\n",
      "- Freshly ground black pepper (to taste)\n",
      "- 1-2 tablespoons of butter or oil (for cooking)\n",
      "- Optional fillings: cheese, herbs, vegetables, meats, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Equipment:\n",
      "- Non-stick skillet (8-10 inches)\n",
      "- Whisk or fork\n",
      "- Spatula\n",
      "- Mixing bowl\n",
      "\n",
      "### Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prep Your Ingredients:**\n",
      "   - If you’re using fillings (like cheese, herbs, or vegetables), prepare them in advance. Chop vegetables finely and pre-cook any that require longer cooking times (like mushrooms or bell peppers).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Whisk the Eggs:**\n",
      "   - Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper. Whisk vigorously until the yolks and whites are fully combined and the mixture is slightly frothy. This incorporates air, which helps create a fluffy omelette.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Heat the Skillet:**\n",
      "   - Place your non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the butter or oil and let it melt, ensuring it coats the bottom of the pan evenly. The pan should be hot enough that the butter foams but doesn’t brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add the Eggs:**\n",
      "   - Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet. Allow them to sit undisturbed for a few seconds until the edges start to set. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Stir Gently:**\n",
      "   - Using a spatula, gently stir the eggs in a circular motion, pulling the cooked edges toward the center while tilting the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges. This technique helps create a uniform texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Cook to Desired Consistency:**\n",
      "   - Continue to cook until the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top. This usually takes about 1-2 minutes. The residual heat will finish cooking the eggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Add Fillings:**\n",
      "   - If you’re using fillings, sprinkle them over one half of the omelette. Be careful not to overfill, as this can make it difficult to fold.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Fold the Omelette:**\n",
      "   - Using your spatula, gently fold the omelette in half over the fillings. Let it cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute, allowing the cheese to melt and the inside to finish cooking.\n",

      "4. **Reputation**: For businesses, a data breach can be a PR nightmare. It’s like spilling coffee on your white shirt right before a big meeting.
